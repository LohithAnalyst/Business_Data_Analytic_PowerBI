# 📊 AtliQ Hardware - Business Data Analytics Project

This project is a part of a real-world analytics work in a fictional consumer electronics company called **AtliQ Hardware**. The company is rapidly expanding across multiple countries but still relies on Excel for analytics, leading to inefficiencies and missed opportunities—particularly a major financial loss in Latin America due to a lack of actionable insights.

This repository documents the end-to-end business intelligence solution built using **Power BI**, **SQL**, and **Excel**, aiming to improve the company’s decision-making capabilities and reporting infrastructure.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

AtliQ Hardware, a fast-growing electronics company, uses Excel files to handle its data analytics. However, Excel's limitations in handling large datasets and generating timely insights have negatively impacted business performance. A recent significant loss in Latin America highlighted the urgent need for a more scalable and insightful analytics solution.

This project addresses those gaps by building a robust Power BI dashboard supported by clean data modeling, DAX calculations, and automation capabilities.
